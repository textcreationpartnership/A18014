         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Therefore although the Lord both commandeth and commendeth the labour and diligence of man, as the meanes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is willing to exhibite vs his graces: yet doe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:19367:19"/> all our labours and diligence nothing profit vs therin, except there be both loue and grace in the Giuer, that is, in God, who iuſtifieth and frameth mans heart to his Image and will, for the ſake of his ſonne. For this grace and mercy procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from that diuine loue, doth euer preuent vs, and go before our faith, our loue, our vertues, our Iuſtice. Yea, this is the ſame whereby wee haue further engendred in our hearts, and made able to apprehend that Iuſtice, the which as a good Tree groweth and buddeth and beareth fruite: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all thoſe godly vertues, qualities, and actions which are required of that man whom the Lord hath iuſtified. And therefore in our iuſtification,<note place="margin">Two things in our Iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification.</note> there is not onely the faith of the Belieuer, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the grace of him that iuſtifieth.

And hereof is it, that when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of mans iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, being very warie that nothing thereof be yeelded to mans workes or merits, hee ſaith that we are iuſtified, ſometimes by grace, ſometimes by mercy, ſometimes by faith approaching grace: for it is moſt certaine (as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith againe) that <hi>the grace is of him that calleth;</hi>

In which ſenſe, <hi>Abraham</hi>

                  <hi>for he is very ready to forgiue.</hi> And this (as it ſeemeth) <hi>Cicero</hi> expounded in the word <hi>Mercy,</hi> when ſpeaking in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation of <hi>Caeſar</hi> (as alſo <hi>Auguſtine</hi> citeth it) he ſaid: <hi>Nulla de virtutibus tuis, nec admirabilior, nec gration Miſericordia eſt.</hi>

                  <hi>There is not any one of all thy vertues, either more praiſe worthie, or more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Mercie.</hi> Sometimes for that affection of loue, wherby the pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are naturally touched towards their children, &amp; again the children towards their parents: the friend towards his friend, the brother towards his brother, &amp; the neighbour towards his neighbour: ſometimes for Almes deedes, &amp; ſuch like: whereof examples may bee taken from many places in the holy Scriptures. Indeed, the word <hi>Cheſed,</hi> comprehendeth al thoſe particular vertues,<note place="margin">Cheſed, or Mercie.</note> being as the <hi>Species</hi> or branches thereof: but yet I find not that the ſame which the word ſignifieth in his large acceptation, can be either comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded or fullie expreſſed in any of thoſe particulars, no more then the whole can be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined within any one part therof. More aptly the generall word <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitas</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bonitas.</note> or Goodnes well conteineth it: for this may be extended to euerie vertue, eſpecially to <hi>Mercie,</hi> by the which it is expreſſed. Therefore the <hi>Mercie</hi> of God is often called his goodnes, &amp; himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the higheſt Good, is called <hi>Mercifull:</hi> for that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19367:23"/> by <hi>Mercy</hi> his goodneſſe is worthily declared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all his Creatures. In the like ſenſe we name them good men, whoſe Chriſtian loue and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to and for others, are made apparant in the workes of Mercy.</p>
               <p>But to auoide thoſe doubts which might riſe of the diuerſitie of tranſlations, that ſhall beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent vs, which not onely the <hi>Septuagint</hi> haue yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but alſo that the Lord Ieſus himſelfe (by the teſtimonie of the Euangeliſt) hath confirmed, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;<note place="margin">Hoſe. <hi>6.6.</hi> Mat. <hi>9.13</hi> and <hi>12.7.</hi> In Moral.

               <p>This word (after <hi>Cregory</hi>) accepted in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſignification, is made <hi>miſero corde:</hi> that is, of an afflicted or troubled heart, which either being ſorrowfull for anothers miſery, taketh on him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  </note> amplifieth the ſame, ſaying; it is a certaine paſſion, proceeding from the compaſſionate, towards them which are vnworthily and by iuſt meanes afflicted. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this vertue is not perfected, but in that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is declared, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath a definition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, including either member with effect. <hi>Mercy</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is the affection of the minde condoling, with ſome addition of a benefite, as whereby we may both take compaſsion of our afflicted neighbour, and helpe to relieue him with that which is our owne.</hi> The which definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath foure principall branches; The firſt whereof is, that Mercy is <hi>an affection of the minde,</hi> againſt the opinion of them which place this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:19367:23"/> onely in externall actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. For neither are thoſe to be eſteemed vertues, which haue not their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall in the heart or minde of man. Therefore as <hi>Wiſedome</hi> ſaith, <hi>Giue me thine hart:</hi> So thoſe Scribes and Phariſes were reiected of the Lord, and their workes reprobated, becauſe whiles they ſeemed to honour him with their lippes, their hearts were farre away. The next is, that <hi>Mercy</hi> is that affection of the minde which <hi>condoleth,</hi> that is, ſorroweth and lamenteth together, with and for another. Or as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> againe ſaide: <hi>Aliena miſeriae in noſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thirdly, in this definition is found <hi>ſomewhat added of our beneuolence,</hi> whereof our deſtreſſed neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour might be relieued, comforted, or eaſed: for it little helpes the afflicted that wee condole with him in his condition, except that alſo we exhibite and beſtowe ſomewhat, whereof hee might hope for remedy or reliefe. To this the Apoſtle perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ſaid: we ſhould remember the words of the Lord Ieſus; that <hi>it is better to giue, then to receiue.</hi>

               <p>But here it may be demanded, that as there be diuers pointes in the labour of husbandrie (as the care of ſheepe and cattell noted in <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Iacob:</hi> the planting of vineyardes obſerued in <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> and ſuch like, commended &amp; vſed from the beginning, by holie men) lawfull for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: ſo alſo whether the tilling of the ground which <hi>Cain</hi> vſed, and which for mans ſin was cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, be no leſſe lawfull and commendable.

               <p>By this is meant the altring of the affection, and the conuerſion of the minde.

This is that true vertue which commeth of that true Good of his Son Ieſus, and of the Holy ghoſt, and deſireth the good things, not onely of this life, but alſo of the life to come. This is that, which fighting againſt all doubtfulneſſe, dooth promiſe vs to be heard, &amp; that we ſhall thereby obtaine the good things deſired for the ſake of the Mediator. Therefore, as the Lorde in the olde Teſtament hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded men to call vpon him in troubles, with a promiſe to heare and helpe: ſo the holy men of that time haue duly obſerued it. Againe, as in the newe Teſtament, our Sauiour hath both taught and commanded his Apoſtles to pray in his name to the Father, for daily foode &amp; neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of nature, for pardon of treſpaſſes, for their defence againſt the diuell, and ſuch: ſo they thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

For this is (as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaid) <hi>Locutio ad Deum, quando legis Deus tibi lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiter: quando oras cum Deoloqueris: A ſpeaking to God: when thou readeſt, God ſpeaketh to thee: when thou praieſt, thou talkeſt with God.</hi> An other calleth it an humble conuerſion to God,<note place="margin">Hugo.</note> with the mouth of the minde, aſsiſted with fath, hope and charitie: and touching the good operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and effects thereof, ſaith an other: <hi>It clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the heart, withdraweth it from terrene af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, cleanſeth it from vices, lifteth it vp to heauenly things, yeeldeth him more capable and worthy to conceiue the ſpirituall good thinges.</hi> This dooth our Sauiour Chriſt worthily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, when he ſaith, that his Father giueth the holy Spirite to them that aske the ſame of him in his name: by the which Spirite, he meaneth all the graces and bleſſings of the holy Ghoſt.

That is, the <hi>Tawe,</hi> or that yron Rope which embracing the Beame, aſſureth it to the Tractory or Lambe. By this is meant that <hi>Spirituall Loue,</hi> which is ſo often commended and commaunded vnto the brethren of Chriſt, as whereby, not onely the mortification of the fleſh is faſtened to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hope, and ſo the former is the better ſuſtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and performed by the latter: but alſo the whole <hi>Soole,</hi> with his parts holden together by the helpe of the Key of Chriſtian faith.

Neither if mans heart be good, can it be good of any other occaſion, then by louing that well which is good: nor can the ſame be euill, if euer it be of any thing elſe, ſauing in not louing well that thing which is good.</p>
               <p>As this <hi>Taw</hi> is made of three or foure yron rings, or lincks of yron faſtened one wtihin an other, in the order of a chaine, the greateſt wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of compaſſeth or embraceth the Beame: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond lincked to the firſt, the third to the ſecond, and the fourth to the third, which is alſo aſſured to the Tractory or Lambe.

And ſpeaking of the nature, dignitie and office there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, hee thought hee could not ſufficiently exalt the honour of the ſame:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.</note> but thus hee ſaith. <hi>Though I ſpeake with the tongues of men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells, and haue not Loue, I am as a ſoundiing braſse, or tinckling Cimball. Though I had the gift of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:19367:88"/> and knew all ſecrets, and all knowledge: yea, if I had all faith, ſo that I could remoue moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and had not Loue, I were nothing. And though I feede the poore with all my goods: and though I giue my body to bee burned, and haue not Loue, it profiteth mee nothing. Loue ſuffereth long, is bountifull, enuieth not, boaſteth not, is not puffed vppe, diſdaineth not, ſeeketh not her owne, is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked to anger, thinketh not euill, reioyceth not in iniquitie, but reioyceth in the truth: ſuffereth all things, beleeueth all things, hopeth all things, and endureth all things.

                     <hi>Verſe.</hi> 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Now abideth Faith, Hope and Loue: theſe three, but the chiefeſt of theſe is Loue.</hi> Therefore Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> peruſing <hi>Pauls</hi> praiſe of this moſt honourable vertue, ſeemeth to recapitulate his manifolde members in his deſcription thereof. Thus is (ſaith hee) a right Will turned vtterly away from all earthly and preſent thinges, ioyned in ſeperable to GOD, and vnited with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine fire of the holye Spirite, from whence it proceedeth, and is ſaide to be enkindled, eſtraunged from all filthy pollution, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of corruption, empaired with no kinde of immutabilitie: ſuperiour to all thinges which are carnally minded: the ſtrongeſt of all affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, deſirous of holy contemplations, not at any time conquered of any other in any thing: the ſumme of all good actions: the health of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:19367:89"/> the end of the heauenly lawes: the death of all crimes: the life of vertues: the ſtrength of the fighters: the palme of the victors: the armour of ſacred mindes: the cauſe of good deſerts: the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the perfect, that, without the which, no man pleaſeth God: fruitfull in the repentance, gladſome in them that profite: glorious in thoſe which perſeuere: victorious in the Martyrs: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable in all beleeuers: the ſame, in the which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery good worke whatſoeuer, hath and holdeth life. Finally, becauſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath conioyned together faith, hope and loue, wee finde them ſo placed in this <hi>Soole,</hi> and conioyned, that albeit we may diſtinguiſh them, yet diuide them wee may not: for it is neceſſary the one holde faſt by the other, nor worketh the one without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Taw is ſtaied with the Key or Pinne, and reacheth from thence to the Tractory or Lambe: where, by the Key is ſignified Faith: by the Tractory, Hope: and by the Taw, Loue: as before it is declared. Which three hauing their ſeuerall offices, may well expreſſe the ſame in three words: Faith ſaith, I aſſure it. Hope ſaith, I expect it. Loue ſaith, I tend towards it. For Faith is aſſured of the good thinges which God hath promiſed, nor doubteth ſhee of the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of his word, knowing him to be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Hope with a longing deſire, euer expecteth and looketh to obtain thoſe good things which God hath promiſed, and faith hath aſſured, and therefore is not wearie. Loue in the daily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe

Loe, ſuch a precious Iewell is Loue! Such a powerfull Taw hath <hi>Pieties Plough.</hi> And thus haue we the <hi>Soole</hi> throughly performed.</p>

The wiſedome appeareth in the eyes: the authority in the hornes: their continencie in their caſtracie: their ſtrength in
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:19367:91"/> their labours: their vtilitie in their vſe.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid in the Apocalyps, 5. that the Lambe had <hi>ſeuen eyes:</hi> which noted his great wiſedome<note place="margin">1 <hi>Wiſdome.</hi>

By theſe two eyes is ſignified knowledge of the Lordes Law and Commandements, and a willing obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the ſame. And againe, here is the loue of God, and the loue of man, alluding to thoſe two tables in the Lawe. In a word, here is both wiſedome, and the worke of wiſedome, in the Oxe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Lambe hath alſo ſeuen hornes, which noteth the perfect power and authoritie<note place="margin">2 <hi>Authoritie</hi>

               <p>It is certaine, that the <hi>Diuell</hi> hath a <hi>Plough,</hi>

And ſurely,<note place="margin">Why many men ſowe and plough iniquitie.</note> what by meanes of his ſophiſticall argumentes, or for that the waies of Impietie, ſeeme pleaſant to mans eye, and luſtfull to the fleſh: or for that the path of true Pietie is narrowe and painefull to the men of this life, many men, yea mightie men of the worlde, haue rather choſen to plough with Impietie, then with Pietie, and therein to ſerue rather to the Diuell, then to God.</p>

                  <q>Wherefore art thou proud ô man? the Sonne of God was made humble for thee.

The Sonne of God came in man, and was humbled: that God was made man, thou ô man know thy ſelfe, for thou art a man.

               <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Culter</hi> of this Soole, is that <hi>Shame</hi>

So ploughing for Righteouſneſſe, and ſeeking after goodneſſe, we ſhall no doubt timely reape, and enioy the fruites thereof.

               <p>The ſecond thing promiſed is, <hi>Riches,</hi> not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of this worlde, but of God. The holy Apoſtle, as alluding to <hi>Salomon,</hi> ſaith: that <hi>Godlineſſe is great Riches.</hi>

               <p>The riches of this world is tranſitorie and vaine; but this is that, which being obteined, is of more
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:19367:125"/> value then all worldly treaſures, the which they eaſily contemne, that haue this Iewell in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, although in the former the fruite of Righteouſneſſe and reward of Pietie, is plainely expreſſed: yet <hi>Salomon</hi> addeth one other word, to ratifie and ſtrengthen the ſame:<note place="margin">

But as the glory of Chriſt Ieſus was extolled, in that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manifeſted him in the fleſh, by the operation of his Spirite, in his mightie workes, and merits for mans ſaluation: and as the glory of the Father ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peared in thoſe his louing mercies declared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men in his deare ſonne Ieſus: ſo doth the glory of man appeare firſt in this world, by that it pleaſeth God to declare him, by his grace, iuſtified,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:19367:125"/> ſanctified, adopted, called, elected and honoured in his Sonne Ieſus. Next, in the reſurrection, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation, and glorification of Ieſus: who hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken on him mans nature, and the ſame preſerued and glorified, hath taken ſeiſe and poſſeſſion for man in the kingdome of his Father. Thirdly, it ſhall be moſt apparant, when being ſet and placed on the right hand of Chriſt, in the great iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wee ſhall not onely be commended in our labours done by faith, before both Angells and men: yea, in the preſence of the moſt <hi>High God:</hi> but, being pronounced iuſt, and the bleſſed Saints of the Father, we ſhall receiue the honour of that his moſt glorious kingdome prepared for vs from the beginning.</p>
               <p>The fift Reaſon is taken from the apt compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with the Raine:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>5.</hi> The compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with the Raine.</note> by the which the former ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments are not onely confirmed, but amplified. The Lorde commeth to raine downe <hi>Righteouſnes</hi> here: <hi>Righteouſneſſe</hi> is likened to the Raine, which commeth downe from heauen: and that as for many, ſo chiefly for theſe cauſes. Firſt, for that the Raine cleanſeth the aire from the corrupt vapours which riſe of the earth. 2. The Raine of all other waters is the ſweeteſt in taſte. 3. It is more ſubtile and light then any other water. 4. It is pure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mixtures. 5. It watereth the barren earth, to make it fertile. 6. It giueth nouriſhment and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the fiſhes in the Sea, and other waters. 7. It qualifieth the force of fiers. 8. It makes the land tractable to the labour of the Husbandman. 9. It waſheth cleane the waies wherein men trauell.
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:19367:126"/> 10. It commeth downe from aboue, and not from beneath. In ſemblable manner, <hi>Righteouſneſse</hi> is of that nature, that it cleanſeth the cogitations of men from noyſome affections and ſtudies: It is the ſweeteſt ſolace of a godly mans minde: it ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth their conſciences, which thereby diſcharged of the burthen of ſinne, aſpire to the heauens. It is not contaminated with the fantaſies of vaine perſons: nor the doctrines of deceiueable Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes. It giueth moyſture to our barren natures, whereby wee yeeld forth fruite acceptable to the Lord. It aſſwageth the ardencie of mans concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence. It perſwadeth both our bodies &amp; ſoules to yeeld obedience both to the will and word of God. It cleanſeth our conuerſations, as whereby we may the better trauel to the harbour of health: And comming downe from the Lord, is of his Highneſſe, made vnto vs an influence of his grace and goodneſſe; as whereby wee be ſo ſeaſoned and tempered, as we remaine acceptable vnto his glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>6.</hi> The manner of beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</note>Sixtly, the manner of powring downe theſe Graces, as Raine on the Earth, puts vs in minde of three principall Vertues in the Lord, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowes them: as firſt his large bountie: ſecondly, his fine liberalitie: thirdly, his exquiſite wiſdome. His bountie is apparant in his gift: his liberalitie, in the abundant largeneſſe thereof: and his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in an orderly diſpoſition. The gift is of his loue: his liberalitie of his abundant riches: and his wiſedome of his eternall prouidence. He giueth, and that freely, without reſpect of any reward, or
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:19367:126"/> any thing in man, mouing him therevnto. In his liberalitie hee giueth to euery man abundantly: yea, the very wicked are not left without the ſenſe of his goodneſſe, in that he ſendeth forth his Raine to fall as well on them, as on his Saints. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are full of Metaphors, to ſet forth this the Lords liberalitie to men. Although therfore there was a time when the Prophet <hi>Ioel</hi> threatned the diſobedient with warres and troubles: in the which they ſhould bee conſtrained <hi>to breake vp their Plough Shares into Swordes:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioel.</hi> 3.10.</note> whereon ſhould follow famine and ruine in the Lords anger. Yet the Prophet <hi>Iſay,</hi> to declare this large liberalitie of the Lord, at an other time, propheſied, that the people ſhould conuert <hi>their Swordes into Plough Shares, and their Speares into Sythes:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.4.</note> for he would ſend them great plentie of fruites in the time of peace. Thirdly, as the Lord powres downe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the Raine with an orderly diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on the earth: ſo powres he forth the effects and fruites of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe on his people, after his diuine will in wiſedome, as whereby euerie one hath enough thereof to ſocietie, as the earth hath of the timely raine, when it falles thereon. Not of mans poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie or power, but of his owne goodneſſe, to whom it is lawful to do as himſelf liſteth, with that which is his owne.</p>
               <p>The ſeuenth Argument is taken from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of righteouſneſſe in our ſelues:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>7.</hi> The benefite in our ſelues.</note> for he ſaith, that <hi>hee will raine Righteouſneſſe on you:</hi> that is, on them which haue ſowne vnto themſelues for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, or laboured for Pietie. Surely the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:19367:127"/> fruite of this Grace ſhall be our owne, if we ſeeke the Lorde after this method and rule. So ſaid the ſweete <hi>Pſalmist</hi> concerning the godly:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.37.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt eate the labour of thine hands.</hi> Againe, they ſowe the fieldes, and plant Vineyards, which <hi>bring forth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelues fruitefull encreaſe:</hi> for he <hi>bleſseth them, and they multiply exceedingly.</hi> What Husbandman is he, wich is not encouraged to labour in his field, if he once perſwade in aſſurance, that he ſhall not onely haue great encreaſe, but that the profit ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhall be his owne? What Merchant man ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentureth not on the raging Seas, with the more boldneſſe, which hopeth that the gaines of his trauels, ſhall redound to himſelfe? And truly ſo is that man animated and encouraged in his voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that hopeth for his proper commoditie, and reward of the ſame. So ſaith the Prophet to the righteous; <hi>The Lorde will raine downe Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe:</hi> that is, the full fruites and effectes of Righteouſneſſe <hi>vpon you.</hi> As Chriſt ſaid in his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to his Father: <hi>I pray not for the world, but for them whom thou hast giuen me out of the world.</hi> So ſaith the Lord by the Prophet: I ſay not, that thoſe large Graces are laid vp of my loue,<note place="margin">To whom Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</note> and ſo beſtowed on the worldlings, which followe after their owne luſtes in voluptuouſnes and ſinne (for theſe things appertaine not vnto them): but onely for the <hi>Righteouſneſſe</hi> which are exerciſed in the workes of Pietie, which haue laboured in my Vineyard, and therein borne the burthen and heate of the day: for it is meete (according to my promiſe) that by the merite of my Sonne, they now reſt from their
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:19367:127"/> labours, and haue a refreſhing: yea, that they bee rewarded, and all their workes follow them in the glory of their Sauiour.</p>
               <p>The eight and laſt Argument is taken from the Lords kinde fauour vnto his choſen,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>8.</hi> The Lordes kindeneſſe and regard</note> and his loue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regard of this buſineſſe to be performed, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in this word, <hi>He commeth.</hi> For firſt, in that himſelfe being ſo high and glorious, ſhould not onely reſpect man, but alſo vouchſafe to come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, intimateth vnto vs, with what gratious kindnes, and kinde grace he embraceth his Saints. To this the Lord alluding by his Apoſtle ſaith:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apo.</hi> 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I ſtand at the doore and knock: if any will open vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, I will come in and ſup with him, and hee with me.</hi> It is eſteemed no meane loue of a Prince, &amp; grace of a ſubiect, when the Prince vouchſafeth to come vnto his ſubiect, reſting himſelfe vnder the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his houſe: and ſuch is the Lords kinde loue vnto vs: and ſuch is our honour by his grace.</p>
               <p>Next, hereof is gathered the great regard that the Lorde God hath of the performance of his word, and preſeruation of his choſen: for howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he hath riſen vp early, &amp; ſent forth his ſeruants with a charge, not onely to worke, but to ouerſee, direct, and alſo to recompence the labourers with meete rewards: yet ſuch is his regard, that hee like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe commeth himſelfe, not onely to ſee the thing performed, but to effect it, or at the leaſt to ſupply by his powerfull hand, wiſedome &amp; prouidence, that whatſoeuer hath beene found in them wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or defectiue, according as himſelfe ſaith in the Prophet <hi>Ioel:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
